Gary's recos for Pazdro heart GSH data
1. qq plots
2. log, rankZ transform
3. scatterplot GSH, GSSG
4. log-log scale
5. additive lm fit
6. regression - look at intercept; significant? make biological sense?' red flag if not
7. GSSG adj for GSH and vice versa - map GSHw/ GSSG as covar
8. ratio fallacy - 1947 paper


suggestions for Becca's early work
is cohort/gen a factor variable?
cohort x genotype as interactive covariate
cohort x sex ...
calc heritability - use sex + gen
selective sweep on chr 2 - distortion effect
gen 30 litter2
gen 32 litter 2
gen 35 litter 1

use model.matrix (sex, gen) sex + gen
rankz transform (not log ) - outliers
sex + gen as factor
